\section{Formulating the problem}
\subsection{Definition of $TCP$}
Let $G = (V, E)$ be a weighted graph with distance measure $d$,
$r \geq 0$ be the sight distance and $P$ be a cycle in $G$. We say
that $P$ is a \emph{sightseeing tour} if there for all $v \in V$ exists a
$w \in P$, such that $d(v, w) \leq r$. We then define the \emph{traveling
couple problem}, to be the problem of finding a sightseeing tour $T$ minimizing
the \emph{tour length}, $\sum_{(v,w) \in T} d(v, w)$.

We then define the related decision problem $TCP$ to be the problem of determining
whether there exists sightseeing tour of length at most $l$ in $G$. More formally,

\begin{align}
    TCP = \{ \langle G, d, r, l \rangle\ :& G = (V,E) \text{ is a graph}, \\
                                          & d \text{ is a distance measure on } G, \\
                                          & r \geq 0, \\
                                          & G \text{ has a sightseeing tour with tour length at most } l \}
\end{align}

\subsection{Reduction from $HAM-CYCLE$}
We wish to show that any instance of $HAM-CYCLE$ can be reduced to an instance of $TCP$.

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph, and define a distance function $d$ on $G$ to be
\[
    \forall v, w \in V : d(v, w) = 1.
\]
Furthermore, let $r = \frac{1}{2}$.

We now claim, that any solution to $TCP$ in this graph corresponds to a Hamiltonian cycle.

Since the distance between any two vertices is greater than the sight radius, we must have that
all vertices are visited. Furthermore, we know that any sightseeing tour is a cycle by definition.
A Hamiltonian cycle makes use of precisely $|V|$ edges, and since each edge has length $1$, this gives
us that each solution to $TCP$ in this graph must have length $|V|$.

This gives us, that
\[
    \langle G, d, r, |V| \rangle \in TCP \Rightarrow \langle G \rangle \in HAM-CYCLE,
\]
which provides the reduction that proves $TCP$ to be NP-complete.
