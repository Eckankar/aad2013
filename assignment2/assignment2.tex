\section{Formulating the problem}
\subsection{Definition of $TCP$}
Let $G = (V, E)$ be a weighted graph with distance measure $d$,
$r \geq 0$ be the sight distance and $P$ be a cycle in $G$. We say
that $P$ is a \emph{sightseeing tour} if there for all $v \in V$ exists a
$w \in P$, such that $d(v, w) \leq r$. We then define the \emph{traveling
couple problem}, to be the problem of finding a sightseeing tour $T$ minimizing
the \emph{tour length}, $\sum_{(v,w) \in T} d(v, w)$.

We then define the related decision problem $TCP$ to be the problem of determining
whether there exists sightseeing tour of length at most $l$ in $G$. More formally,

\begin{align*}
    TCP = \{ \langle G, d, r, l \rangle :\ & G = (V,E) \text{ is a complete graph}, \\
                                           & d \text{ is a distance measure on } G, \\
                                           & r \geq 0, \\
                                           & G \text{ has a sightseeing tour with tour length at most } l \}
\end{align*}

\subsection{Reduction from $HAM-CYCLE$}
We wish to show that any instance of $HAM-CYCLE$ can be reduced to an instance of $TCP$.

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph, we then define $G'$ to be the complete graph with
the vertices $V$, and define a distance function $d$ on $G'$, given by
\[
    \forall v, w \in V : d(v, w) = \begin{cases} 1\ \ \text{if}\ \ e_{vw} \in E \\
                                                 2\ \ \text{otherwise}
                                   \end{cases} 
\]
Furthermore, let $r = \frac{1}{2}$.

We now claim, that any minimal solution to $TCP$ in $G'$ corresponds to
a Hamiltonian cycle in $G$.

Since the distance between any two vertices is greater than the sight radius,
we must have that all vertices are visited in order for $TCP$ to be solved.
Furthermore, we know that any sightseeing tour is a cycle by definition. Since a
Hamiltonian cycle makes use of precisely $|V|$ edges, and each edge has a weight of
at least $1$, we have that a any Hamiltonian cycle in $G'$ must have length at least $|V|$.

In particular we notice, that the length of the tour is $|V|$, and thus minimal,
whenever the tour is a Hamiltonian cycle in the original graph $G$.

This gives us, that
\[
    \langle G', d, r, |V| \rangle \in TCP \Rightarrow \langle G \rangle \in HAM-CYCLE,
\]
which provides the reduction that proves $TCP$ to be NP-complete.

\subsection{Exercise 1.2}
An obvious, if rather trivial, example is the following graph (borrowed from exercise 2).

Here the optimal TCP is simply to start at the middle vertex and stay there, which has a length of 0, which is shorter than any 1-tree.

    s.t.     & \\
             % each edge must be either used (1) or not used (0)
             & \forall i, j: e_{ij} \geq 0 \\
             & \forall i, j: e_{ij} \leq 1 \\

             & \forall i: \sum_j (e_{ji} + e_{ij}) \leq 2 \\
             & \forall i: \sum_j (e_{ji} + e_{ij}) \geq 0 \\
             % incoming - outgoing = 0
             & \forall i: \sum_j (e_{ji} - e_{ij}) = 0 \\
             % w_i = exists(incoming)
             & \forall i: (\sum_j e_{ji} - w_i) = 0 \\
             % at least one vertex visited in the viscinity 
             & \forall i: (\sum_{j \in v(i)} w_j) \geq 1 \\
\end{align*}
